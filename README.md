RiscOS Game

Totally not at all based on Star Trek.

All files are in RiscOS format, with the exception of .BAS files which are plain text conversions of the tokenised BASIC files for easy diffing at GitHub.

Tested on RPCEmu emulating a Risc PC - StrongARM with 32MB of RAM.

Controls so far:

Left Arrow: Left
Right Arrow: Right
Up Arrow: Incrase velocity
Right Arrow: Decrease velocity
Q: Display debug info

This was written as a BASIC re-learning exercise - any or all of this could have been implemented the wrong way.
